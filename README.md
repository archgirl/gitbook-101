# Gitbook 101
## An Introductory Guide for Using Gitbook

Gitbook is a tool that integrates with GitHub for publishing Markdown files in a responsive, easily updatable, and maintainable format.

This Gitbook serves as a repository for understanding how to use Gitbook, specific quirks and their workarounds, and plugins. 

A good portion of this work is on plugins: which ones work, how to configure them, special syntax needed, and, of course, the plugin installation process.
